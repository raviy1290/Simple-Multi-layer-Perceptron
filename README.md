# Simple-Multi-layer-Perceptron
Simple Multi layer Perceptron using sklearn library

It uses winery data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine
which has wine data set of 3 different winery with 13 other properties associated with wines produced.

It first uses sklearn multi layer perceptron classifier to train the model using wine data and map it to winary.
Next, the model can be used for checking if test wine (with 13 properties) belongs to which winary (classification)
